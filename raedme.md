## Introduction
Deliveroo Order Management System is a Python-based desktop application;  I creat and developed this app to make the process of placing, managing, and viewing delivery orders easier. The application is built using a Tkinter library that makes provision for users to:
_Add customer orders with various delivery options.
_Display the sorted orders by price using bubble sort.
_Securely administer payments with validation for numerous types of payments( credit card , debit card , paypal)
_Allow potential riders to apply to join the delivery service via a rider application form.
