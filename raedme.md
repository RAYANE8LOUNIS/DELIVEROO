## Introduction
Deliveroo Order Management System is a Python-based desktop application, I creat and developed this app to make the process of placing, managing, and viewing delivery orders easier. The application is built using a Tkinter library and jnson that makes provision for users to:
_Add customer orders with various delivery options.
_Display the sorted orders by price using bubble sort.
_Securely administer payments with validation for numerous types of payments( credit card , debit card , paypal)
_Allow potential riders to apply to join the delivery service via a rider application form.
This system is perfect for small-scale delivery businesses or an educational project that concentrates on GUI applications and order management.

## Installation
To run the app , ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed, and then install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: The project currently uses standard Python libraries (tkinter, datetime, json), so no additional dependencies are needed.


## How to run the app
